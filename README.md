## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
Detailed Explanation of the Proposed Solution

The proposed Smart Crop Advisory System (SCAS) is a low-cost, AI-powered platform designed specifically for small and marginal farmers who often lack access to real-time agricultural advice. It provides personalized, localized, and actionable crop-related guidance by integrating multiple technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile communication, and satellite data.

How It Addresses the Problem

Lack of scientific crop selection
Poor access to timely pest control
Low digital literacy and language barriers
Disconnected from market pricing and buyers
Limited resources for experimentation
Low smartphone penetration and poor internet

Innovation and Uniqueness of the Solution

Multimodal Access
AI + Traditional Knowledge
Hyper-local Customization
End-to-End Farmer Support
Low-Infrastructure Deployment
Community Feedback Loop
Policy and Planning Integration
